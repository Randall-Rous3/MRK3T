* Include a beautiful, professional README.md (use markdown)

* Include a minimum of 3 models (Postgres, Sequelize, or Mongoose)
* Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model
* Use functional components with React hooks or with React Redux. Your project cannot have class components.
* Have at least 60 meaningful git commits - You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
* Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice).
