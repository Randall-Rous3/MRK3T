## MRKT is a place where local restaurants can source their food, drinks, and plate-ware from local substainable sources. For conscientious restaurant owners it is important to source their food locally.
## Sourcing locally ensures your food is fresh, healthy and keeps money in the community.

## MVP
* Be a new repo
* Have separate directories for the frontend (client) and backend within the main repository
* Include a beautiful, professional README.md (use markdown)
* Your README should have links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
* Include a minimum of 3 models (Postgres, Sequelize, or Mongoose)
* Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model
* Use functional components with React hooks or with React Redux. Your project cannot have class components.
* Have at least 60 meaningful git commits - You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
* Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice).
* Be deployed
